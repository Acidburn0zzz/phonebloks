# Phonebloks

After Phonebloks got a new website and openness is part of our company culture, we've decided to put in on GitHub too. So that other developers can report issues, fix bugs or just give us feedback.

We haven't thought of a local development enviroment for third-party-developers yet, therefore you need to think of your own one (probably an empty WordPress setup containing this theme) and then file a pull request.

Thanks in advance for taking part in this! :blush:
