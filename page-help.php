			<h2>Join the Community</h2>
			<p>We love to see all of you involved in bringing this idea to life. Itâ€™s our greatest goal too! We have set up an online community where we you can discuss all aspects of the project and where we will post challenges when we need your help or input. We believe that development should be done openly and together with anyone who wants to take part. So, if you want to take part, please join us!</p>

			<p>Right from the start all off your amazing support made this project a success. In order for us to keep going ahead we need continued support. People that will spread the word about Phonebloks. Educate the rest of the world, read our <a href="#">full story</a> and pass it along! Liking our posts and retweeting us on social media helps enormously.</p>

			<h2>Become a Partner</h2>
			<p>We would love to have your company, or the company you work for, as a partner. The more partners that are involved in this project the bigger the chance of success. If the company that you represent is interested in becoming a partner, we have set up a partner page with all the information you need.</p>
