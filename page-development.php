					<p>Google started out as a search engine but we have grown into so much more. We build products that we hope will make the web better, and therefore your experience on the web better.<br><br>With products like Chrome and Android, we want to make it simpler and faster for people to do what they want to online. Above all, It means making our products work better so that people can spend time on the stuff they are good at, like enjoying time with family, camping in the wilderness, painting a picture or throwing a party. We are not there yet, but we are working on it.</p>
